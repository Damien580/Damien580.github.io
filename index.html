            <p>My name is Damien Redd. I am a father of three, a husband, a Chef, and a former business owner making a career change. I spent most of my life in restaurants and kitchens, ultimately owning my own catering company and a food truck. I eventually realized that I wanted to see my family more and pursue something new that I am passionate about. I have always loved technology and information, so have decided programming will be my next big adventure. I am currently enrolled in a bootcamp to get my Python certificate, and am looking to break into the tech sphere. I play disc golf from time to time, and enjoy shooting clays as well as target shooting. </p>
